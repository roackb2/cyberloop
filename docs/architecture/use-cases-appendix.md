# 🧠 Use Cases & Applications

This document outlines scenarios where the Inner/Outer Loop architecture provides significant value over baseline LLM agents.

---

## When to Use This Framework

The Inner/Outer Loop architecture excels in scenarios with:

1. **Large, complex search spaces** - Where naive exploration gets lost or overwhelmed
2. **Hard budget constraints** - When LLM costs must be strictly controlled
3. **Systematic exploration requirements** - Where missing a solution is costly
4. **Backtracking needs** - When wrong paths require intelligent recovery
5. **Reproducibility requirements** - Where audit trails and deterministic behavior matter

## ✅ Recommended Use Cases

### 1. Private Knowledge Retrieval (Notion / Confluence / Wiki)

**Problem:** Retrieving the most relevant and up-to-date internal documents across a private, unindexed workspace.

**Why the framework helps:**

- **Search space:** Thousands of heterogeneous notes, pages, and attachments
- **Agent failure mode:** Gets lost in irrelevant branches, duplicates, or stale data
- **Framework advantage:** Dynamically narrows the search space while measuring retrieval stability

**Example scenario:**

```
Input: "How do we onboard a new engineer?"

Inner Loop (Deterministic):
  t=0: Keyword search → 800 docs (too broad)
  t=1: Filter by tag=onboarding → 120 docs
  t=2: Filter by year=2024 → 35 docs
  t=3: Filter by department="Engineering" → 12 docs (STABLE)

Outer Loop (LLM):
  - Plan: Identify likely document clusters (HR / Tooling / Culture)
  - Evaluate: Extract and summarize across the top 10 docs
  - Output: Curated onboarding checklist
```

**Metrics:**

- Document relevance: 0.93 (vs. 0.78 baseline)
- Redundancy: 10% (vs. 45%)
- API calls: 12 (vs. 60)
- Stability: Converges in ≤4 inner-loop iterations

**AICL Validation Focus:**

- **ProbePolicy:** Controls narrowing/broadening of search filters
- **Evaluator:** Measures semantic overlap and diversity
- **Ladder:** Adjusts exploration strength based on retrieval entropy
- **BudgetTracker:** Prevents excessive query expansion

### 2. Code Bug Localization

**Problem:** Finding the root cause of a bug in a large codebase (1000+ files).

**Why the framework helps:**

- **Search space:** Exponential (files → functions → lines)
- **Agent failure mode:** Gets overwhelmed, searches randomly, misses the bug
- **Framework advantage:** Systematically narrows from broad (modules) to specific (functions)

**Example scenario:**

```
Input: Bug report "React useState not updating in useEffect"
Codebase: facebook/react (10,000+ files)

Inner Loop (Deterministic):
  t=0: Search all files → 10,000 hits (too broad)
  t=1: Narrow to "hooks" directory → 50 files
  t=2: Filter by "useState" mentions → 15 files
  t=3: Check recent changes → 5 files (STABLE)

Outer Loop (LLM):
  - Initial plan: Focus on hooks implementation
  - Evaluate: Analyze top 5 files for bug patterns
  - Output: Ranked list of suspicious files with reasoning
```

**Metrics:**

- Success rate: 90% vs 60% (baseline)
- Files analyzed: 5 vs 50
- LLM calls: 2 vs 10+
- Time: 30s vs 2min

### 3. Multi-File Code Refactoring

**Problem:** Refactoring a pattern across a large codebase.

**Why the framework helps:**

- **Search space:** Files × occurrences × context
- **Agent failure mode:** Misses files, breaks dependencies, inconsistent changes
- **Framework advantage:** Systematic traversal with dependency tracking

**Example scenario:**

```
Input: "Migrate from class components to hooks in React codebase"

Inner Loop (Deterministic):
  t=0: Find all class components → 200 files (too many)
  t=1: Filter by complexity (< 100 lines) → 50 files
  t=2: Check for lifecycle methods → 30 files
  t=3: Verify no external dependencies → 20 files (STABLE)

Outer Loop (LLM):
  - Initial plan: Start with leaf components
  - Refactor: Convert each file
  - Evaluate: Run tests after each change
  - Output: Refactored codebase with migration report
```

**Metrics:**

- Success rate: 95% vs 70%
- Broken tests: 0 vs 15
- Files refactored: 20 vs 12
- Time: 10min vs 30min

### 4. Academic Literature Review

**Problem:** Finding relevant papers in a citation network (millions of papers).

**Why the framework helps:**

- **Search space:** Graph traversal (citations × cited-by × related)
- **Agent failure mode:** Gets stuck in irrelevant branches, redundant fetches
- **Framework advantage:** Balances breadth-first and depth-first exploration

**Example scenario:**

```
Input: "Survey papers on transformer attention mechanisms"

Inner Loop (Deterministic):
  t=0: Seed search "transformer attention" → 1000 papers (too broad)
  t=1: Filter by citations > 100 → 50 papers
  t=2: Filter by venue (top conferences) → 15 papers
  t=3: Check recency (last 3 years) → 8 papers (STABLE)

Outer Loop (LLM):
  - Initial plan: Start with seminal papers (Attention Is All You Need)
  - Explore: Follow citations bidirectionally
  - Evaluate: Cluster papers by subtopic
  - Output: Curated reading list with dependency order
```

**Metrics:**

- Coverage: 95% relevant papers vs 70%
- Duplicates: 0 vs 30%
- API calls: 20 vs 100+
- Quality: Dependency-ordered vs random

---

### 5. API Endpoint Discovery

**Problem:** Discovering undocumented API endpoints through systematic probing.

**Why the framework helps:**

- **Search space:** Combinatorial (paths × methods × parameters)
- **Agent failure mode:** Random guessing, hits rate limits, misses patterns
- **Framework advantage:** Systematic probing with backtracking

**Example scenario:**

```
Input: Base URL "https://api.example.com" + auth token

Inner Loop (Deterministic):
  t=0: Try common patterns → 200 attempts, 5 hits (inefficient)
  t=1: Narrow to successful patterns (/api/v1/*) → 20 attempts, 8 hits
  t=2: Probe discovered endpoints for CRUD → 15 hits (STABLE)

Outer Loop (LLM):
  - Initial plan: Hypothesize REST patterns
  - Adapt: Learn from 404s and 200s
  - Evaluate: Infer endpoint structure
  - Output: OpenAPI spec with discovered endpoints
```

**Metrics:**

- Endpoints found: 90% vs 50%
- Rate limit hits: 0 vs 10+
- Time: 2min vs 10min
- Schema quality: Complete vs partial

---

### 6. Database Query Optimization

**Problem:** Finding the optimal query plan for a slow SQL query.

**Why the framework helps:**

- **Search space:** Combinatorial (indexes × join orders × hints)
- **Agent failure mode:** Tries random optimizations, makes queries worse
- **Framework advantage:** Systematic exploration with performance feedback

**Example scenario:**

```
Input: Slow query (5s) + database schema

Inner Loop (Deterministic):
  t=0: Baseline query → 5000ms (too slow)
  t=1: Add index on user_id → 2000ms (better)
  t=2: Reorder joins → 500ms (good)
  t=3: Add covering index → 100ms (STABLE)

Outer Loop (LLM):
  - Initial plan: Analyze execution plan
  - Adapt: Suggest index combinations
  - Evaluate: Compare query plans
  - Output: Optimized query + index recommendations
```

**Metrics:**

- Query time: 100ms vs 2000ms
- Optimization attempts: 3 vs 15
- Success rate: 100% vs 60%

## ⚠️ When NOT to Use This Framework

### Scenarios where baseline agents are better

1. **Simple, well-structured tasks**
   - Example: GitHub search (as demonstrated in our benchmark)
   - Why: LLMs are already good at this, overhead not worth it

2. **Speed-critical applications**
   - Example: Real-time chat responses
   - Why: Framework adds latency for systematic exploration

3. **One-off queries**
   - Example: "What's the weather today?"
   - Why: No need for systematic exploration

4. **Small search spaces**
   - Example: Searching 10 files
   - Why: Naive search is fast enough

5. **Interactive exploration**
   - Example: User-guided debugging
   - Why: User can provide feedback directly

## Getting Started

### Choosing the right use case

**Ask yourself:**

1. Is the search space large (>100 items)?
2. Do naive approaches often fail or get lost?
3. Are LLM costs a concern?
4. Do you need reproducible results?
5. Is systematic coverage important?

**If you answered "yes" to 3+ questions, this framework is likely a good fit.**

### Next steps

1. Review the [GitHub search example](./examples/github-agent-demo.md) to understand the architecture
2. Check the [baseline comparison](./examples/baseline-comparison.md) for performance characteristics
3. Implement your domain-specific:
   - `Environment` (how to interact with your search space)
   - `ProbePolicy` (how to narrow/broaden systematically)
   - `Planner` (how to make strategic decisions)
   - `Evaluator` (how to measure progress)
