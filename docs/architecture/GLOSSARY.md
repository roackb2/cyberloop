# AICL Glossary

A reference glossary for contributors and IDEs implementing or extending the AICL / CyberLoop framework.

---

| Term | Definition |
|------|-------------|
| **AICL** | Artificial Intelligence Control Loop — a framework for bounded, feedback-regulated intelligence. |
| **Inner Loop** | Deterministic layer controlling fine-grained exploration using `ProbePolicy`. No LLM calls allowed. |
| **Outer Loop** | Strategic planning layer using `Planner`. Handles LLM calls, evaluation, and replanning. |
| **Probe** | Lightweight check that estimates feasibility or improvement direction. |
| **ProbePolicy** | Deterministic controller for the inner loop. Decides the next action based on current state and probes. |
| **Planner** | High-level reasoning module (LLM-based) responsible for planning, evaluation, and strategic adaptation. |
| **Evaluator** | Component that computes progress and stability feedback after each step. |
| **Ladder** | Internal relaxation gradient regulating exploration intensity. Higher values allow broader search. |
| **BudgetTracker** | Tracks cumulative resource consumption (tokens, steps, or cost units). |
| **ControlBudget** | Splits budget tracking into inner and outer loops, enforcing distinct limits. |
| **StrategySelector** | Optional meta-controller that switches policies or probes based on feedback entropy. |
| **FailureClassifier** | Identifies the type of failure (e.g., instability, stagnation) to inform the selector. |
| **TerminationPolicy** | Optional rule defining multi-objective stop conditions (e.g., diminishing returns). |
| **Environment** | The external system or dataset the agent interacts with (e.g., API, database, documents). |
| **Action** | A state-transforming operation generated by the Policy. |
| **Feedback** | Quantitative signal summarizing stability, improvement, or degradation after an action. |
| **Ladder Level** | Scalar in [0,1] controlling how exploratory the agent is. |
| **Stability Window** | Acceptable range for feedback fluctuations considered “stable.” |
| **Trace** | JSON log recording the full trajectory of a run, including states, feedback, ladder, and costs. |
| **Reproducibility** | The ability to replay a run deterministically with identical results given the same seed. |
