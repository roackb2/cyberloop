# 🧠 CyberLoop

### Reference Implementation of AICL (Artificial Intelligence Control Loop)

> **Status:** 🧩 *Work in Progress (early-stage research and prototyping)*

> Uncontrolled intelligence grows powerful but fragile.
> Controlled intelligence grows stable — and endures.

## Overview

**CyberLoop** is the reference implementation of **AICL (Artificial Intelligence Control Loop)** —
a control-theoretic framework for building **sustainable, self-correcting intelligent systems**.

AICL models intelligence as a **closed feedback loop** consisting of four key modules:

| Module | Role |
|--------|------|
| `Environment` | Provides observable states and constraints |
| `Policy` | Generates actions and adapts to feedback |
| `Evaluator` | Measures performance and stability |
| `Ladder` | Regulates exploration vs. exploitation (the “relaxation ladder”) |

Together, these form a reusable architecture for developing **agentic systems** that can explore unknown domains while maintaining stability.

---

## Goals

- 🔁 **Control Loop Intelligence** — build agents that adapt stably, not just optimally
- 🧩 **Interface-Driven Design** — plug in domain-specific adapters with clear contracts
- 🧠 **Sustainable Learning** — maintain coherence under dynamic environments
- 🌍 **Open Source Research Platform** — validate the AICL framework across domains
